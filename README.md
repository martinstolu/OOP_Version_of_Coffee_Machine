â˜• OOP Coffee Machine
This project simulates a virtual coffee machine built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The machine allows users to order drinks like espresso, latte, and cappuccino, while managing resources and processing virtual coins.

ðŸ”§ Features
Choose from a menu of drinks: espresso, latte, or cappuccino

Processes coins: quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies

Tracks machine resources (water, milk, coffee)

Handles insufficient resources and payments

Supports special commands:

report: View remaining resources and money earned

off: Shut down the machine

Project Structure

main.py              # Entry point: handles user input and orchestrates the machine
coffee_maker.py      # Defines the CoffeeMaker class for managing ingredients
money_machine.py     # Handles payment and coin processing
menu.py              # Contains Menu and MenuItem classes for drink data

ðŸŽ¯ Concepts 
Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Methods, Encapsulation)

Clean code separation across modules

Real-world problem simulation

User input handling and basic CLI interaction
